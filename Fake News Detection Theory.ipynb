    "Do you trust all the news you hear from social media? All news are not real, right? So how will you detect the fake news? The answer is Python. By practicing this advanced python project of detecting fake news, you will easily make a difference between real and fake news. Before moving ahead in this advanced Python project, get aware of the terms related to it like fake news, tfidfvectorizer, PassiveAggressive Classifier."

Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting. Unlike most other algorithms, it does not converge. Its purpose is to make updates that correct the loss, causing very little change in the norm of the weight vector."
